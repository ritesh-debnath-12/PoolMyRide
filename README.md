# 🚗Pool My Ride🚗

This repository contains the browser-based interface as well as the back-end architecture for the PoolMyRide web-based software

## ❔ What is it?
The core idea behind "**Pool My Ride**" is to create a community-driven carpooling platform that connects drivers and riders traveling in the same direction. This platform aims to leverage the unused capacity of personal vehicles, making daily commutes more cost-effective and environmentally friendly

### How so?
We will look at an example, between Ramesh and Suresh.

- Ramesh lives in Habra, West Bengal, and travels to Salt Lake Sector 5 daily for work.
- Suresh lives in Ashoknagar, West Bengal, and needs to travel to Barrackpore, which is on the way to Salt Lake.
- Ramesh posts his route on PoolMyRide, indicating he has one available seat in his car.
- Suresh searches for a ride from Ashoknagar to Barrackpore and finds Ramesh's route.
- Suresh books a seat in Ramesh's car, and they share the ride
- Suresh and Ramesh have not only helped each other but, have indirectly helped towards reduction of traffic and reduction of vehicular pollution! 😲
### TL;DR: 
*In simple words it is an application which allows you to earn while you drive around.*

## 🤔 How is this any different from {insert transport service}?
Unlike traditional ride-sharing services, PoolMyRide does not employ dedicated drivers; instead, it allows regular individuals to offer rides to others, thus fostering a sense of community and shared responsibility.

This is however, not all, **we are also tackling traffic congestion as well as vehicular problems!** and that too with no added costs! This happens indirectly based on how helpful our community is towards themselves. 😎
